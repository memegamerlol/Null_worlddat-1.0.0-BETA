🌀 null_worlddat

null_worlddat is a cursed-style Minecraft mod that makes your world feel like it’s been corrupted or left unfinished. Instead of adding new features, it creates disturbing, glitchy events that break the rules of normal gameplay.

Current events include:

⚠️ Chat Punishment: Type in chat, and you’ll be teleported high into the sky.

⚡ Login Curse: Upon joining, you’re struck by lightning and instantly killed.

👤 Null Joins: A strange, faceless figure named Null appears, making the world feel haunted.

This mod is designed to unsettle players and give your world a scary, “broken data” atmosphere — like the game itself doesn’t want you there.
